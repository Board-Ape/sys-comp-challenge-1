# Static Comp Challenge: 1
Include a README with the repo that provides a brief overview of the project, and images of both the original comp and your version.
## For my comp challenge I have decided to choose Eminem as the individual subject. Although I don't listen to rap very often, I can appreciate when an artist of any genre has as much talent as he does. Diving into his lyrical composition with any of his songs will give you an idea of the sheer poetic genius he's capable of.
