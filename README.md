# Static Comp Challenge: 1

## For my comp challenge I decided to choose Eminem as the subject. Although I don't frequently listen to rap, appreciation and admiration is difficult to ignore when the individual is this talented. Diving into his lyrical composition by selecting any random song he's composed, will give you an idea of the sheer poetic genius he's capable of.
